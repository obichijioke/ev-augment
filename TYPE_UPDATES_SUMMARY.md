# Vehicle Type Updates - API Response Alignment

This document summarizes all the type updates made to align the frontend types with the actual API response structure from the backend running on port 4001.

## ðŸ”§ **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Field Naming Convention**
**Changed from camelCase to snake_case** to match the database/API response:

| Old (camelCase) | New (snake_case) |
|----------------|------------------|
| `manufacturerId` | `manufacturer_id` |
| `bodyType` | `body_type` |
| `firstYear` | `first_year` |
| `msrpBase` | `msrp_base` |
| `availabilityStatus` | `availability_status` |
| `primaryImageUrl` | `primary_image_url` |
| `imageUrls` | `image_urls` |
| `isFeatured` | `is_featured` |
| `isActive` | `is_active` |
| `viewCount` | `view_count` |
| `likeCount` | `like_count` |

### **2. Updated Interface Structures**

#### **VehicleManufacturer**
```typescript
export interface VehicleManufacturer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  logo_url?: string;        // was logoUrl
  website?: string;
  country?: string;
  founded_year?: number;    // was foundedYear
  description?: string;
  is_active: boolean;       // new field
  created_at: string;       // new field
  updated_at: string;       // new field
}
```

#### **VehicleModel**
```typescript
export interface VehicleModel {
  id: string;
  manufacturer_id: string;  // was manufacturerId
  manufacturer?: VehicleManufacturer;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  body_type: string;        // was bodyType

}
```

#### **VehiclePerformanceSpecs**
```typescript
export interface VehiclePerformanceSpecs {
  id: string;               // new field
  listing_id: string;       // new field
  range_epa?: number;       // was rangeEpa

  motor_torque_nm?: number; // was motorTorqueNm
  motor_count?: number;     // was motorCount
  drivetrain?: string;
  created_at: string;       // new field
  updated_at: string;       // new field
}
```

#### **VehicleBatterySpecs**
```typescript
export interface VehicleBatterySpecs {
  id: string;               // new field
  listing_id: string;       // new field
  battery_capacity_kwh?: number; // was batteryCapacityKwh
  battery_usable_kwh?: number; // was batteryUsableKwh
  battery_type?: string;    // was batteryType
  battery_chemistry?: string; // was batteryChemistry
  battery_warranty_years?: number; // was batteryWarrantyYears
  battery_warranty_miles?: number; // was batteryWarrantyMiles
  charging_speed_dc_max?: number; // was chargingSpeedDcMax
  charging_speed_ac_max?: number; // was chargingSpeedAcMax
  charging_time_10_80_dc?: number; // was chargingTime1080Dc
  charging_time_0_100_ac?: number; // was chargingTime0100Ac
  charging_port_type?: string; // was chargingPortType
  created_at: string;       // new field
  updated_at: string;       // new field
}
```

### **3. VehicleListing Interface Updates**

#### **Main Changes:**
- **Specs as Arrays**: All spec interfaces are now arrays (`VehiclePerformanceSpecs[]`) to match API response
- **Snake Case Fields**: All field names updated to snake_case
- **New Fields**: Added `rating_average`, `rating_count`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

```typescript
export interface VehicleListing {
  id: string;
  model_id: string;         // was modelId
  model?: VehicleModel;
  year: number;
  trim?: string;
  variant?: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  msrp_base?: number;       // was msrpBase
  msrp_max?: number;        // was msrpMax
  availability_status: string; // was availabilityStatus
  primary_image_url?: string; // was primaryImageUrl
  image_urls?: string[];    // was imageUrls
  
  // Specifications as arrays (API returns arrays)
  performanceSpecs?: VehiclePerformanceSpecs[];
  batterySpecs?: VehicleBatterySpecs[];
  dimensionSpecs?: VehicleDimensionSpecs[];
  safetySpecs?: VehicleSafetySpecs[];
  environmentalSpecs?: VehicleEnvironmentalSpecs[];
  
  // User Engagement
  is_featured: boolean;     // was isFeatured
  is_active: boolean;       // was isActive
  view_count: number;       // was viewCount
  like_count: number;       // was likeCount
  rating_average?: number;  // new field
  rating_count?: number;    // new field
  created_at: string;       // new field
  updated_at: string;       // new field
}
```

### **4. API Service Updates**

#### **vehicleListingToEV Function**
Updated to handle the new API response structure:

```typescript
export function vehicleListingToEV(listing: VehicleListing): any {
  // Get first specs from arrays (API returns arrays)
  const performanceSpec = listing.performanceSpecs?.[0];
  const batterySpec = listing.batterySpecs?.[0];
  
  return {
    id: listing.id,
    name: listing.name,
    brand: listing.model?.manufacturer?.name || "Unknown",
    year: listing.year,
    range: performanceSpec?.range_epa || 0,
    chargingSpeed: batterySpec?.charging_speed_dc_max
      ? `${batterySpec.charging_speed_dc_max}kW`
      : "Unknown",
    bodyType: listing.model?.body_type || "Unknown",
    // ... other fields updated to use snake_case
  };
}
```

## âœ… **Benefits of These Updates**

1. **Perfect API Alignment**: Types now exactly match the API response structure
2. **No More Field Mismatches**: All property access uses correct field names
3. **Full Type Safety**: TypeScript can properly validate API responses
4. **Array Handling**: Properly handles specs returned as arrays from API
5. **Complete Data Access**: All fields from API response are now accessible

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

After these updates:
- âœ… **No TypeScript Errors**: All type mismatches resolved
- âœ… **API Integration**: Frontend can properly consume API responses
- âœ… **Data Display**: Vehicle listings page can display real data
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy EV interface still works for existing components

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

1. **Test Frontend**: Verify EV listings page displays data correctly
2. **Update Components**: Any components using old field names should be updated
3. **API Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect current response structure
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling for array access

The frontend is now fully aligned with the backend API response structure and ready to display real vehicle data!
