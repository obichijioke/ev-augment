## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ev-nextjs/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**

   Create a `.env` file in the backend root directory:

   PORT=5000

   # Supabase Configuration
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret

4. **Database Setup**

   The application uses Supabase as the database. Follow these steps:

   a. **Create a Supabase project** at https://supabase.com

   b. **Set up the database schema**:
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy and execute the SQL from `database/schema.sql`
   - This will create all necessary tables, indexes, triggers, and RLS policies

   c. **Configure Storage**:
   - Create storage buckets for file uploads:
     - `avatars` - User profile pictures
     - `vehicle-images` - Vehicle photos
     - `marketplace-images` - Marketplace listing photos
     - `documents` - Document uploads
   - Set appropriate bucket policies for public/private access

   d. **Verify Setup**:
   - Ensure all tables are created successfully
   - Check that RLS policies are enabled
   - Test database connectivity with your API keys
