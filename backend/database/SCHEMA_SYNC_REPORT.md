## Key Schema Features

### **Data Types and Constraints**
- All tables use UUID primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()` default
- Timestamps use `now()` default function
- Comprehensive CHECK constraints for data validation
- Foreign key relationships with appropriate CASCADE/SET NULL actions
- UNIQUE constraints on critical fields (usernames, emails, slugs)

### **Advanced Features**
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage (settings, specifications, etc.)
- Array columns for storing lists (tags, images, features, etc.)
- Decimal precision for monetary and measurement values
- INET data type for IP address storage
- Text arrays for storing multiple string values

### **Performance Optimization**
- **130+ indexes** created for optimal query performance
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Partial indexes where appropriate
- Covering indexes for frequently accessed data

### **Security Implementation**
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on 18 sensitive tables
- **25+ RLS policies** implemented for data access control
- User-based access control for personal data
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Public/private data separation

### **Database Functions and Triggers**
- **Automatic timestamp updates** via triggers on all tables with `updated_at` columns
- **Forum statistics maintenance** via triggers for thread/reply counts
- **Category statistics maintenance** for forum categories
- **Custom functions** for data integrity and automation

## Row Level Security Policies

- `vehicles` - Users can manage their own vehicles, public vehicles viewable by all
- `charging_sessions` - Users can only access their own charging data

### **Content Management**
- `blog_posts` - Published posts public, authors manage own posts, moderators manage all
- `blog_comments` - Comments on published posts viewable, users manage own comments
- `marketplace_listings` - Active listings public, sellers manage own listings

## Synchronization Results

✅ **Successfully Retrieved:**
- All 42 table definitions with exact column specifications
- All primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
- All 130+ performance indexes
- All 25+ Row Level Security policies
- All database functions and triggers
- Complete data type specifications including precision and scale

✅ **Schema File Updated:**
- `backend/database/schema.sql` completely synchronized
- Proper SQL formatting and organization maintained
- Comprehensive documentation comments added
- Schema version metadata included

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Synchronization:** Schedule monthly schema synchronization to keep local documentation current
2. **Migration Management:** Use the synchronized schema as the source of truth for future migrations
3. **Development Alignment:** Ensure all developers use this schema for local development setup
4. **Backup Strategy:** The synchronized schema serves as a complete backup of the database structure

## Next Steps

1. Review the updated `backend/database/schema.sql` file
2. Update any local development databases to match the live schema
3. Use this schema as the foundation for future database migrations
4. Consider implementing automated schema drift detection

**Note:** This schema represents the exact state of the live Supabase database as of January 8, 2025. Any future changes to the database structure should be reflected in both the live database and this schema file to maintain synchronization.
